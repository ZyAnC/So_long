So_long is a simple 2d game.Built on MLX42 lirbary.This is a project in 42cursus.
I added extra actions to all parts corresponding to up, down, left, and right. 
This is also where the coding process gets really interesting, maybe I will add character attacks, enemy health deduction, etc. in the future
