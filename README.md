  So_long is a simple 2d game.Built on MLX42 lirbary.This is a project in 42cursus. I added extra actions to all parts corresponding to up, down, left, and right. 
This is also where the coding process gets really interesting, maybe I will add character attacks, enemy health deduction, etc. in the future.
  This project should run with mlx42,if you want to run this project should install cmake and some package for that.see more detail in  [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42)
